# Exploring Death in the ICU
 
Our main goal is to anaylyze the importance of certain vitals from patients staying in the ICU in the effort to predict survivability. 

## Ew, why?

In addition to our curiousity regarding our own mortality, we thought this would be a good opportunity to learn about the aspects of our health that could be the difference between life and death! This dataset is very rich, over 150 columns of information per patient! One of our primary goals is to use supervised machine learning to determine what 5-10 features have the most impact on a patients survival. 
After answering the initial question, we would like to explore these circumstances in order to find what values of body temperature, BMI, blood pressure, heart rate, etc are optimal for survival. 


It would be truly fascinating if we could compare our data with healthcares guidelines to see if we came to a similar conclusion.
