# Exploring Death in the ICU
 
Our main goal is to anaylyze the importance of certain vitals from patients staying in the ICU in the effort to predict survivability. 

## Why?

In addition to our curiousity regarding our own mortality, we thought this would be a good opportunity to learn about the aspects of our health that could be the difference between life and death! This dataset is very rich, over 150 columns of information per patient! One of our primary goals is to use supervised machine learning to determine what 5-10 features have the most impact on a patients survival. 

The ICU is a unique department of any hospital. Many patients are not in a state to communicate their medical history. We would like to high-light the importance of taking vitals, and the valued information about the patient can be surmised from standard hospital tests and measurements. 



It would be truly fascinating if we could compare our data with healthcares guidelines to see if we came to a similar conclusion. We will be communicating via slack to evenly divide all imporant tasks and to notify the team of any new discoveries.
